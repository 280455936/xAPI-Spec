# xAPI-Spec

This Github repository contains the xAPI Specification. xAPI is a learning
technologies interoperability specification that describes communication
about learner activity and experiences between technologies. The specification is
divided into three documents:

*   Part One:   [About the Experience API](./xAPI-About.md#partone)
*   Part Two:   [Experience API (xAPI) Data](./xAPI-Data.md#parttwo)
*   Part Three: [Data Processing, Validation, and Security](./xAPI-Communication.md#partthree)

## Specification versions

The current version of the specification is
[1.0.3](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/).

The next version of the specification has not been planned. 

## What to do if the spec is unclear

If when implementing the specification you find something is unclear or
unhelpful, it may be that the others have similarly found that
section unclear and that it has been fixed in the
[development version of the specification (1.0.3)](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/1.0.3/xAPI.md)
which is being developed by the xAPI Working Group. You can and should look at
the development version of the specification for reference, but be aware that
this version has not been published; it could contain errors and might be
changed before it is released.

If your confusions and concerns have not been addressed in the [development version)](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/1.0.3/xAPI.md),
you can help to improve the specification by
[raising an issue here](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/issues). When
raising an issue, please give as much detail as you can in regards to:

* Which part/parts of the specification you are reading.
* Your understanding of what these parts mean.
* The product and feature you are implementing xAPI in; what's the use case you
  are trying to achieve?
* How you would like the specification to be improved. Suggest some specific new
  wording if you like!
